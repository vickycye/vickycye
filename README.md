### Welcome To My GitHub!
My name is Vicky and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Washington, with an anticipated graduation date somewhere
between June-December 2026. 

It's still currently under construction, but here is my [personal portfolio website](https://vickycye.github.io/vickycye/)!
I recently added a blog section to record my thoughts throughout important milestones in life, and I hope you enjoy reading them :D

In my free time I like to listen to music, draw, or play instruments (such as piano and violin).
