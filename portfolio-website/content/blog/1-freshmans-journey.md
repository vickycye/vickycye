The campus looks different at dawn.

I never would have known this eight months ago when I stumbled bleary-eyed into my 8:30 am Linear Algebra class, the sound of the alarm still echoing in my ears. Back then, mornings were my enemy--a harsh reminder that perhaps that I had bitten off more than I could chew. 

I remember move-in day vividly. My father had to sit in the back seat while holding onto mountains of cardboard boxes, and my mother was fussing over sheets and storage containers while I prenteded not to be terrified. I had spent my summer grinding through Calculus 3 and the last course to an introductory computer science course sequence at the local community college, convinced that academic achievement alone would smooth my transition to university life.

"You'll thank yourself later," I told myself as I puzzled through LaGrange errors while my high school friends posted photos of themselves in front of Mount Fuji or on the beaches of Cancun. "This is an investment."


### Fall Quarter: Ambitious or Stupid?

My first week on campus, I had clutched my ambitious schedule almost like a shield. I had Linear Algebra and Discrete Math, as well as several other electives to fulfill GenEd requirements. I had carefully selected the most challenging courses aviailable to me at that time. In lecture halls filled with running-start students and confident upperclassmen, I felt simultaneously proud and utterly alone. Besides my high school friends that lived with me in the same dorm, there was not a single familar face in my classes. 

Free time became a luxury as problem sets and coding assignments seemed to multiply. My routine in the first quarter was sleeping at around midnight and panicking at 7:45 am to sprint across campus and up three flights of stairs. My roommate, who wisely selected more balanced courses, seemed to be transitioning into college easier. 

I didn't really question my choices until someone online asked why I decided to do all this. "I'm getting ahead," I replied, though simultaneously the knot in my stomach tightened. Was I missing something important about college life by burying myself in coursework?

### Winter Quarter: Finding My People

It was during a particularly mundane evening after our Data Structure and Parallelism midterm that I really got to know the two freshmen I started talking to. One was homeschooled, and he really had a passion for math--something that I madly respected. He took every opportunity to learn, and didn't hesitate to share his knowledge with others. Another one's experiences felt similar to mine, as he took several courses over the summer too, to get a head start. "You're insane," we told each other--whatever that implied.  

Our shared academic masochism forged a very unique connection. We began meeting regularly to discuss approaches to solve homework problems, and occasionaly bringing more friends to expand the study group. What began as a difficult solo journey turned into a fun, slightly-less-impossible shared experience. 

I started to recognize that my study habits needed refinement. Instead of cramming late into the night, we established consistent study blocks throughout the week. We learned to break down complex problems together, taking turns explaining concepts until everyone understood. I also discovered that trying to reason through by teaching others solidified my own understanding far better than re-reading textbooks and lecture notes alone. 


### Spring Quarter: Growth and Balance

Although it was nice for two quarters, the study group (or may I now say, the friend group) started to diverge. We had neared the end of the mid-level introductory courses and everyone had their own interests, so we started to register for different classes. Although everyone still keeps in touch and we still occasionally chat in the CS building's cafe, those who I've met in the beginning are still with me. 

It's fascinating how our friendships adapted as our academic paths diverged. What started as relationships built around shared homework struggles evolved into something beetter. Now, I intentionally go to places to say hi to them or just to catch up on life. We have a group chat where we share everything from math memes to genuine celebrations of each other's achievement. The support system remains intact, even if we're no longer sitting together in the same class. 

I didn't really notice the contrast in my academic journey until spring quarter, when our ML professor asked, on the first day of lecture: "How many of you are freshmen?" And the 4 of us sitting in the front row raised our hands. "Wow, that's more than I thought!"

But still, I wonder, am I missing out on the true college experiences? Some of my friends went to parties, while others participated in numerous sports, and others joined many clubs and found their new friends that way. I decided to make a change and stop being a loner that only studied. 

With my improved study efficiency, spring quarter finally gave me room to breathe. I joined the ultimate frisbee intramural team with my high school friends, something I'd always thought about trying but never felt I had the time for. The physical activity cleared y mind, and I met people from compeltely different majors who viewed the world through different lenses. I also started refining my own website--what you're reading right now--a project that is completely unrelated to any coursework, but deeply satisfying in its own way. 

By the middle of this quarter, I had discovered a strange new ritual. One day I had to wake up at 5am for a research group meeting based on the east cost. Dragging myself out of bed that morning, I was certain it would be torture. Yet I was unexpected by how alert and productive in those early hours I was, than I'd ever been during my midnight cramming sessions. The campus had a peaceful quality before the daily rush, and I could think with a clarity that eluded me in the evenings. That single meeting changed everything about my daily rhythm. 

I slept at 9 or 10 pm each day, just to wake up at 6 am to leave the dorm and watch the sunrise as I walk to a building of choice to study. This morning walk--just two hours before my first class--has become very valuable time. I'm almost always alone this early in the morning, and I get to take all the time to reflect, figure out what I need to accomplish during the day, and catch up on news or stocks. 

Morning studying offered unexpected benefits I'd never considered. The libraries and study spaces sit mostly empty, giving me my choice of the best tables (with outlets)! The few people who are around tend to be seriuos about their work--creating an environment of focused energy that I find incredibly motivating. And the quiet! No music blasting from a random car driving by, and no fire-alarms being pulled at noon, no constant stream of distractions--just the space to think.

As I round the corner near the population health building, I seemed to have seen myself again, hunched over notes at an outdoor table--determined, exhausted, and a little lost. 

Eight months ago, I came to college seeking academic challenges. I found them, certainly--but I also found my people. And on mornings like this, with sunlight warming my skin and friendly faces greeting me at every intersection, I realize that was the harder and more valuable lesson all along. 

I still meet new people in every class I take, forming connections that enhance each course in unique ways. But my high school friends who share my dorm and those first two classmates from autumn and winter quarters remain my anchors. With my high school friends, I can truly relax--they know the weirdest me, and there's a comfort in shared history. We can all be silly and goofy in ways I might not feel comfortable with newer friends yet. 

### Looking Forward

As spring quarter winds down and I reflect on my freshman year, I can't help but wonder about the next wave of ambitious students who will arrive in the fall. Will I recognize myself in their determined expressions and color-coded planners? Will they too believe that sheer academic force can substitute for teh messier aspects of personal growth?

I imagine cross paths with them in the CS building--perhaps noticing a group of freshmen huddled next to a whiteboard with the familiar mix of panic and pride. Would they welcome advice from a sophomore who once stood exactly where they are? Or is struggling through that first year something each student needs to experience in their own way?

There's something beautifully cyclical about university life. Next year, I'll be the "upperclassman" in the lecture hall, perhaps intimidatibng to new students just as others once intimidated me. But I'll know something they don't yet--that the real value of college extends far beyond the grades and achievements that seem so all-consuming at first.

If I could whisper something to myself 8 months ago, I'd tell her that yes, the academic challenges are worth it. But also, to look around sooner, to notice the other students fighting the same battles, to reach out earlier. I'd tell her that the friends found along the way will transform not her college experience but also her understanding of why we pursue knowledge in the first place.

As the sun fully rises on this May morning, I tuck away my notes and head towards my ML midterm. The path feels different now--familiar but also filled with possibilities I couldn't have imagined when I first stepped foot into this place. The campus at dawn isn't just a quiet place to study anymore; it's a reminder of how far I've come, how much I've grown, and how many more sunrises will change me for the better.
